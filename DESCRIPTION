Description: DataPuppy allows users to import and archive "batches" of data into a cohesive single database.  It also allows users to "tweak" the data (correct errors, delete bad records, etc.) while maintaining a record of every modification of the data.  Planned functionality will allow the user to reconstruct their database as of any arbitrary date in the past.
